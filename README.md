# Notes

This was a folly into using Jekyll to generate a static site. Initial idea was to have a public area for notes and posts that weren't a complete blog post. It's since been canned! What's remaining is viewable at https://notes.richardballard.co.uk/


The idea and code was ripped from a colleague of my mine, Vincent Humeau - check out his profile for some front-end goodness https://github.com/vinceumo
