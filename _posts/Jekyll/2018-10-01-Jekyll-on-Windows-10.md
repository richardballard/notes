Make use of the nifty Windows 10 feature that allows Linux to be installed as a Subsystem of Windows. This is actual Linux running on a Windows box.

The steps to install Linux on Windows is very straight forward:

1. Turn on 'Windows Subsystem for Linux' within Windows Features
2. Restart Windows to complete installation
3. Search for Linux in the Microsoft Store app
4. Select the Ubuntu app and install it
5. Once installation is complete, run the 'Ubuntu' app from the Start Menu
6. Follow the instructions and create a UNIX user account
